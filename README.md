#MMU Portfolio

<p>This is my website portfolio that I had to create as part of my univeristy project at Manchester Metropolitan University. This will soon be uploaded to my personal live webspace which will be provided by my university. Once my webspace is live I will update this README file with the link to my website.</p>

<p>In the site I have made references to where I acquired third-party JavaScript and CSS files.</p>

<p>Below is the brief we were assigned before starting this project.</p>

<h3>Required Elements</h3>
<p>Your personal site must consist of the following elements with relevant site navigation:

<li>Images - a portrait of yourself and a personal banner or logo.</li>
<li>Background information on yourself, your career aspirations.</li>

<li>Links to relevant (professional) social media.</li>
</ul>
